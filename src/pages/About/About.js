            <p>Dental care Family Practice at Tega Cay believes a patient relationship is a partnership that spans a lifetime and that two-way communication is the key to good health. We strive to provide patient-centered healthcare and invite our patients and their families to be a part of the care team, as equal members in the decision-making and treatment process. Each of our primary care providers goes beyond annual exams and diagnosis or treatments to view each patient as a whole. We work to become familiar with patientsâ€™ lifestyle and health patterns in order to provide comprehensive guidance to managing health care needs.</p>
